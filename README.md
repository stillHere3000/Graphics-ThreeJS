<h1>Three.js Terrain Scene</h1>

<img src="Screenshot_Forest.png" />
This project demonstrates a simple 3D terrain scene using Three.js. It features a textured ground plane representing terrain, randomly placed trees, a skybox for the background, and orbit controls for camera manipulation.

Features
Terrain: A ground plane with elevation data loaded from a .bin file, textured with a ground image.
Trees: Simple tree models created using cylinder and cone geometries, randomly placed on the terrain.
Skybox: A blue sky background created using a box geometry.
Controls: Orbit controls allowing the user to rotate, zoom, and pan the camera.
